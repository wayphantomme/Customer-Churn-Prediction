- Language: Python
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Tools: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🧠 What’s Included

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics visualization

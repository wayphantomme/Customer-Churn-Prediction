# Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using telecom data. The goal is to classify whether a customer is likely to stop using the service (churn) based on their demographic, service usage, and account data.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Filename**: `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`

This dataset includes 7,000+ customer records with 21 features such as tenure, service plans, internet usage, and customer demographics.

## ðŸ§  Methods Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning & Encoding
- Feature Engineering
- Train/Test Split
- Classification Algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Model Evaluation:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

Best model achieved high recall and balanced performance on unseen test data, helping identify customers likely to churn before it happens.

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Or open the notebook directly in JupyterLab.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements

* Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
* Deployment using Flask/FastAPI
* Model explainability with SHAP or LIME
* Use of deep learning for sequential features
